      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I received a PhD from University of Nevada, Reno in Cell and Molecular Biology, but research life was not for me. I also served in the Air National Guard logistics for 10 years. I believe the world is an exciting place and with a little effort, we can all gain experiences that will make us better, more tolerant people.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Siberia, Russia and moved to the United States when I was about 10 years old. I lived most of my life near the West Coast.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy watching tv, cross-stitching, and wood working.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Instead of a title, my dream job is to use my skills to help others. I have experience in various fields of work, but throughout my experience, I have learned that nothing can replace that feeling of accomplishment I get when I know I have made someone else's life a little better. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the great St. Paul/Minneapolis area, MN</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am ready to explore a different career field and web development will offer me a chance to use my skills in a totally different way.</p>
